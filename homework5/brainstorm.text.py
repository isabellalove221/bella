# 1. List 5 topics related to astronomy, physics, technology, science or math that sound interesting to you.
# sonoluminescence
# black holes
# supernova of betelgeuse 
# moon orbit related to tides
# exoplanets 
# 2. For three of these topics, find a dataset, tool, news article, or paper online that relates to it. Summarize how each source relates to the topic in your own words.

# 3. Choose one topic and brainstorm how you could Python skills (loops, conditionals, functions, lists/dictionaries, github, version control) to explore, analyze or create something with it.

# 4. Write down at least two possible project ideas connected to your topic. One should be ambitious (a “dream” version) and the other should be smaller, simpler version that you could realistically finish in a few weeks
